# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java OOP)

## Overview
This is a simple **Library Management System** built in Java using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**.  
It allows users to:
- View all books
- Issue a book
- Return a book

The system runs in the console and uses multiple classes:
- **Book** â€“ Represents a book with title, author, and issue status.
- **User** â€“ Represents a library user with a name and unique ID.
- **Library** â€“ Manages books, users, issuing, and returning books.
- **Main** â€“ Runs the menu-based application.

## OOP Concepts used
- Encapsulation - Private fields with getters/setters.
- Abstraction â€“ Clear separation between book, user, and library logic.
- Polymorphism â€“ Methods like toString() overridden for custom output.
- Inheritance â€“ (Can be extended further if creating specialized book/user types).
